# 🎭 EchoStage — Where Identity Performs

> *“It’s not the real me. But it’s the version that shows up.”*

**EchoStage** is a creative framework for building expressive digital profiles—whether real, fictional, or somewhere in between. Inspired by the aesthetics of performing arts, EchoStage lets anyone publish a person that’s decorated, stylized, and powered by LLM-generated data.

## 🌟 What Is EchoStage?

EchoStage is not about being a performing artist.  
It’s about **performing identity**—through visuals, data, and illusion.

Your person can be:

- ✅ **True** — a real person enhanced by LLM tools  
- ❌ **Fake** — a fully synthetic character created for storytelling  
- 🎭 **Hybrid** — a curated profile that lives between reality and fiction
